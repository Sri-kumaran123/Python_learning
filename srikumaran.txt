21/08/2023, 10:18 am - K bhuvanesh: <Media omitted>
23/08/2023, 6:27 am - K bhuvanesh: The biggest difference between software and the products of other kinds of projects is it's not physical. Software consists of ideas, designs, instructions and formulae. Creating software is almost entirely a cognitive activity.
23/08/2023, 6:29 am - K bhuvanesh: Software Project vs Other Types of Project
23/08/2023, 6:30 am - K bhuvanesh: Many techniques of general project management also apply to Software Project Management. Fred Brooks identified some characteristics of software projects which make them particularly difficult:

1. Invisibility
With Software, progress is not immediately visible since work is logical; however, for physical artifacts like bridges, work progress can be seen from time to time. In Software Development, there is a level of uncertainty.

It isn't easy to accurately define detailed requirements for software projects before starting the development. However, with the introduction of approaches like Agile and Scrum, we can overcome this limitation.

2. Complexity
Software projects contain more complexity than other engineered artifacts. For example, in a bridge, there is a clear structural relationship between parts, whereas software component relationships are much more complicated. We can't measure the complexity of a software project until we work on it.

3. Conformity
Physical systems are governed by consistent physical law, while Software developers have to conform to the requirements of human clients.

4. Flexibility
Software systems are particularly subject to change. A bridge has to be built in a specific order, whereas We can make Software much more flexibly and restructure parts quite freely.

Apart from the above-mentioned, Software Projects are intangible, and managing a software project is more managing interpersonal communication and less about administration. Also, it would be best if you had a highly skilled team of developers, QA, and another stakeholder to develop a software project, unlike making a bridge where skills can be less or more.
23/08/2023, 6:32 am - K bhuvanesh: Many of the techniques of general project management are applicable to software project management, but Fred Brooks pointed out that the products of software projects have certain characteristics that make them different.

One way of perceiving software project management is as the process of making visible that which is invisible.

Invisibility When a physical artefact such as a bridge or road is being constructed the progress being made can actually be seen. With software, progress is not immediately visible.

Complexity Per dollar, pound or euro spent, software products contain more complexity than other engineered artefacts.

Flexibility The ease with which software can be changed is usually seen as one of its strengths. However this means that where the software system interfaces with a physical or organizational system, it is expected that, where necessary, the software will change to accommodate the other components rather than vice versa. This means the software systems are likely to be subject to a high degree of change.

02/11/2023, 8:56 pm - K bhuvanesh: The standard error of the estimate (se), also known as the root mean square error or the standard error of the regression, can be calculated from the ANOVA table. The se measures the distance between values predicted from the estimated regression and the observed values of the dependent variable.

02/11/2023, 9:24 pm - K bhuvanesh: Properties of Regression coefficients
1)The correlation coefficient is the geometric mean of the two regression coefficients
2)Regression coefficients are independent of change of origin but not of scale.
3)If one regression coefficient is greater than unit, then the other must be less than unit but not vice versa. ie. both the regression coefficients can be less than unity but both cannot be greater than unity, ie. if b1>1 then b2<1 and if b2>1, then b1<1.
4)Also if one regression coefficient is positive the other must be positive (in this case the correlation coefficient is the positive square root of the product of the two regression coefficients) and if one regression coefficient is negative the other must be negative (in this case the correlation coefficient is the negative square root of the product of the two regression coefficients). ie.if b1>0, then b2>0 and if b1<0, then b2<0.
5)If θ  is the angle between the two regression lines then it is given by
